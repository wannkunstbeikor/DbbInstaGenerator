# DbbInstaGenerator

This is a tool to automatically generate images to be used in the instagram account of the german basketball club [SG Eichenkreuz Karlsruhe](https://www.sgek-karlsruhe.de/).
It uses the rest api of the [DBB](https://www.basketball-bund.net/), similiar to how their [widgets](https://www.basketball-bund.net/widget/widgets/#!/widgetgenerator/verein/546) works, to get all the games of this club and draws them over a background image in some nice rounded rectangles.
The "reversed" api can be found in the [ApiClasses](https://github.com/wannkunstbeikor/DbbInstaGenerator/tree/master/DbbInstaGenerator/ApiClasses) folder.

The UI was created using the awesome cross-platform [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/), the website is hosted at [here](https://wannkunstbeikor.github.io/DbbInstaGenerator/).

## Note
This could be forked and adjusted to work for a different german basketball club by changing the color of the rectangles and the background to include a different logo.
